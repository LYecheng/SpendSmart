# iOSFinal Project

By Yifan Xiao & Yecheng Li


SpendSmart is an iPhone application designed to help iPhone users of any age group to maintain their personal account book. The App also provides clear categorical and monthly statistics in pie chart and line graph respectively. In addition, a map view of where users spent their money is available in this App. 

The App is a good balance of technical functionality and visual elements. Aiming at motivating people to keep their own financial record and to have a better idea of their financial status, this App enables people to create their own “financial diary” without fuss. Designed with the focus on maximizing user experience, the user interface, which facilitates user input efficiently, helps users to get on track right away. By adding visualized expenditure analysis and subtly animations, we ensured that fun, which every user deserves is not compromised.

The app is created based on tab-bar view template with four tabs: main page, categorical statistics, daily statistics, and map view. The main ViewController takes user input and stores the attributes in a NSDictionary for future retrieval. The map is capable of storing date, amount, type, location, and picture of each transaction. The second ViewController shows percentage-per-category in a pie chart as well as the spent and remaining balance. The third ViewController is a line graph that demonstrates daily expenses of each month, with a table view showing the details of every single transaction on a chosen day. Dropbox backup of user data is also embedded, assuring data integrity. 

It’s a simple fact that our modern society is governed by the constant exchange of money. We are aware that knowing how to properly manage money – tracking and recording your expenses and income, saving and investing – is not only an important skill for thriving, but also an important skill that helps an individual survive. In that regard, we see this fully functional and delicately designed App fits well into people’s everyday life and acts as a tool to make people happy by promoting their financial well-being.
